## Adopting teams must verify

1. All agency-specific content meets WCAG 2.1 AA after replacement.
2. Any forms added have proper error handling and accessible labels.
3. Any third-party scripts (analytics, chat, maps) are assessed for privacy impact.
4. The privacy page (`/privacy/`) reflects actual agency data practices.
5. The accessibility statement (`/accessibility/`) is updated with agency contact info.
